# DidThatFit.me

If you’ve ever gone and bought some clothes in your size from anywhere, and realised it didn’t quite fit, this might be useful to you:

You add items of your own clothing to your user account, saying what brand it is and how well it fit, so next time you go to buy clothes from that brand, you’ll know to get a size up/down! It’ll list the brands by sizes that fit, run big or small for the people who aren’t logged in too.
