# DidThatFit.me

If you’ve ever gone and bought some clothes in your size from anywhere, and realised it didn’t quite fit, this might be useful to you:

You add items of your own clothing to your user account, saying what brand it is and how well it fit, so next time you go to buy clothes from that brand, you’ll know to get a size up/down! It’ll list the brands by sizes that fit, run big or small for the people who aren’t logged in too.

**Features planned:**
+ Login with FB/Twitter/**instagram**
+ Analyse photo for color of clothing
+ **Allow photo upload from phone camera**
+ **Have ‘friends’ feature**
+ Suggest what to wear based on the weather of your location
+ Save outfits
+ Search by **brand**/user/type/category
+ ~~Share OutFit of the day/items/with people who are and are not signed up~~
+ Allow instagram photos to add to database based on hashtags
